# Outlier Detection Using IQR Method

This project demonstrates how to detect outliers in a dataset using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and visualize them with a boxplot.

## Files Included
- `outlier_detection.py`: Python script for detecting and visualizing outliers.
- `SalesDataset_WithOutliers.csv`: Sample dataset with some outliers for testing.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python and required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python outlier_detection.py
```

3. A boxplot will be displayed and the updated dataset will be saved.

## Output
- A boxplot showing outliers.
- Console output of detected outliers.
